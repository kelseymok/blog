# The Mindful Private Citizen

Follows from ["The Earth is a Temple Too"](./earth-is-a-temple-too.md). The answers that fold out from the "what to do about the climate situation" question can be overwhelming. While the real impact can be made only by large corporations, entire industries, and country and world-level policies, there are little things that help me feel mindful about the environment as a private citizen.

My personal theme is  **waste less**.

* How can you reuse something that would otherwise be waste?
* Can you make it yourself? (especially when you can't get the item without plastic)



Bring your own bag and containers to the supermarket

* Many locales have already done away with single-use plastic bags in favour of reusable bags or degradable (paper) bags
* Bring your own containers to buy items at the deli counter or at the salad bar (don't forget to mark the weight of your container with some masking tape)
* Make your own produce/grain/pasta bags

Choose Package free

* Not all containers are recyclable. Choose items that are plastic-free.
* Find stores which follow a zero-package policy

Order Bio/Organic directly through a farmer via Community Supported Agriculture (CSA)

* Supermarkets often require produce of a certain size or shape despite there being a natural variation 
* Support your local farmer by ordering a CSA box. They often deliver only local items (reducing the carbon footprint). Extra points if they do Permaculture Agriculture because it is restoring the soil.
* It's also package free!

Collect veggie scraps

* For a nice sandwich pickle: add veggie scraps to a jar, add water and spices, take weight of the veg/water/spices. Add 3% salt
* Make a spicy indian pickle
* Collect scraps and reuse for veg stock

Make Fruit vinegar

- Put at least at least 200g of fruit cores, bruised fruit with water. For every 250 ml of water, add 1 tbsp sugar/honey. Keep topping it up.
- Alternatively, try the wild fermentation method by adding fruit and water to a jar and hoping that you can herd some wild yeast

Indoor Worm farm (vermiculture)

- Compost your kitchen organic waste
- If you have a garden, you can use the worm casings as soil. Else, you can give this away to neighbours who do
- black gold, worm tea -> great as fertiliser -- because soil that you buy at the supermarket is mostly dead
- you  need microorganisms to break down organic matter and make nutrients available for plants
- check out permaculture resources

Have a small indoor/terrace/balcony garden

* remove yourself from the market for a couple of things like herbs (herbs come wrapped in plastic much of the time)

Offset your carbon emissions

* carbon calculators for your travel
* pay some money to support conservation/reforestation efforts

Collect water from your kitchen

* from salad washing, fruit washing
* water from overnight (if you don't trust it)
* cold tea (without milk/sugar)
* Use it for your garden

Be mindful of the animal products

* This a hard one. There are cultures based on meat and I'm not saying "stop eating meat" but be mindful of how the meat arrived on your plate (and adjust your behaviour to your values)
* Most animals that end up on your plate have lived all their lives in a factory farm with little space, quite stressed out. These factory farms are also a cause of an increase of CO2 and methane (farting cows). Some people stop eating meat for several reasons: environment reasons, they cannot reason with eating another sentient being, etc.
* This also pertains to dairy products
* If you consume animal products, consider sourcing your products from a farm or producer whose practices you can live with



It can be inconvenient at times, but it is up to you to match your lifestyle to your values.
