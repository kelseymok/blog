# The Earth is a Temple Too

Climate change is hanging ominously over our heads. CO2 emissions are always at their all-time historical highs and our global average temperatures are sneaking higher and higher. At the same time, the largest polluting corporations, industries, and countries have put in place policies that would hardly make a difference to reverse the effects of their emissions because of their focus on profits. It all seems so short-sighted. And also frustrating as a private citizen who creates incredibly less emissions compared to industries and yet blamed/guilted to for the current state (we're a part of the problem but the largest problem).

At some point, this world will collapse much like the world did during the 2020 Sars-Cov2 pandemic. When we look back in history, we'll note that some of the larger systemic problems that "could not be fixed" were indeed fixed because the pandemic affected everyone. We also found out that there are some jerks in the world who were unempathetic to their families and friends and communities by not acknowledging the urgency. We saw with awe how the pollution over India gave way to blue skies and mountain views when the world locked down.

It will be a lot of the same with climate change but slower. Certain regions are already feeling the pain: california and australia have experienced devastating fires. The wine growers in the Margaux region of Bordeaux are starting to grow grapes that traditionally only grow in warmer climates; while at the same time battling suddenly violent extremes of weather. Coral reefs around the world are bleaching at an increased rate.

Even in our locales, it is sometimes hard to see the effects. In cities,  we're not actively seeing deforestation because those forests are not at our door step (unless you're downstream of raging bush fires). Cities are often so sterile already that an increased absence of birds, bees, and bugs is barely registering. We're left with anecdotes: "used to see more bugs on the windshield while driving" or "it used to snow more here"

There is data available in the world to use as KPIs, but we're not watching those metrics with a keen eye to enact changes. While we have organisations around the world doing valuable work by collecting the data and serving up the data (they are our unsung heros), there isn't one place to answer our question and the data often requires some standardisation in order to make the relevant comparisons. Sometimes, the data is only updated once per year or every couple of years. Without live data, we see only see the trends and devastating effects when it's too late.

As a human who calls Earth home, I want to respect all that the Earth provides. The entire world is our home, not just the area you spend your time in. If one part of the world is sick, it will affect everyone in some way because we are a system, much like our body. We say "our body is a temple". Well our Earth is a Temple too.

It can be hard to know what to do as a private citizen because the biggest impact is through policy change and accountability. We might not have those contacts, the network, or the visibility to do so (and the information isn't necessarily available on how to start). We can vote for the right people to represent our desires through policy, but politics is well, politics. The feeling of the weight of all of the probelms in the world can be overwhelming. While it not be the most impactful, I find some peace in the little things I can control in my daily life to be mindful about nature and environment. It brings me emotionally closer to the planet. And through my actions, there is a surpring number of people in my own network who came out of the woodwork and are also curious and getting inspired.

 As one more becomes more mindful, it becomes easier to comprehend and reason with the larger problems in the world. On my personal journey, I encountered regenerative agriculture.
