## Monoculture Farming

In our industrial age, the most common type of farming is monoculture farming (either by tradition or government subsidies). Because there is typically only one type of crop, not much biodiversity as a result, and not enough (or not the right ones) natural defences as a result of a single-crop planting, pests are free to ravage the susceptile ecosystem. Farmers normally react by apply pesticides. Pesticides then destroy the microorganisms in the soil that naturally retain water and provide nutrients which causes the soil to desert-ify and turn to dust and erodes. The farmer normally turns to fertiliser. With little water retention, fertiliser runs off into waterways, destroying estuaries, ecosystems, and animals who live and feed in the estuaries, and poisons the drinking water for everyone downstream. As fertilizers and pesticides enter the foodchain, it causes health problems in both animals and humans. At the end of the season, crops are harvested leaving the already ravaged soil bare, which further destroys and existing microorganisms. Without a cover crop for winter, there is no potential carbon sequestion for those months. With the ground turned to dust or rock, farmers then till the land which releases CO2 into the atmosphere. With difficult soil conditions only hardy plants survive. In order to feed the world's population, Big Agriculture companies develop expensive combinations of IP'ed and GMO'ed seeds, fertilizers, and pesticipdes that only work if used together. The farmer then spends quite a bit of money to buy the expensive fertiliser, seed, and pesticide combo to save the farm and livelihood. Third world countries buy the fertiliser, seed, and pesticide combo with subsidies. Big Agro gets richer, but the farmer is still poor, the soil is eroded and has turned to dust, and the world is now dependent on Big Agro to feed itself when the soil, when cared for, should renew itself.

## Polyculture Farming

[Systems Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) helps pick apart this very complex system. It also helps us find the [leverage points](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) to trigger largest changes.

In this case, **change our incentive model**. Governments should first incentivise poly-culture farming, which when researched well can have built-in pest control via "plant guilds" and creation of microclimates by strategically planting trees in specific locations. Colonies of beneficial organisms and fugus networks exist to decompose plant matter on the spot for plant nutrition which leads to both water retention and a lot of earthworms to help process decomposing matter. Not clearing but rather cutting (or sending an army of livestock in to eat) the plant matter and leaving it on the soil provides protection for the microorganisms during winter. Planting cover crops in winter leads to carbon sequestion in the cold months. Animals can consume the cover crop in place and leave behind fertiliser directly on the fields and the remaining cover crop is left in place to decompose. Farmers can then plant using the no-till method (because the soil already has the ideal networks and should not be disturbed) in the soil that is naturally decomposing as a result of the present microorganisms. At harvest time, the cycle repeats, all without the intervention of Big Agro. Hypothetically, we will have also solved the problem of desert-ified agriculture land, run off, usage of fertilizer and pesticides, and the farmer actually making a living instead of depending on Big Agro ("the rich, getting richer").

## Permaculture

The term "Permaculture" was coined by Bill Mollison and David Holmgren in 1978 in their book ["Permaculture One"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3961757-permaculture-one). It means "Permanent Agriculture. Permanent Culture." which covers [polyculture farming](#polyculture-farming).
